Hi! :wave:

I am Ezequiel, and Iâ€™m 33 years old. I am an electronics engineer from the UNLP, Argentina, with ten years of experience in telecommunications, specifically with radiofrequency circuits and antennas.

I am currently interested in learning about cloud computing, and I am also looking to collaborate on data science projects.

Outside the virtual world, I like to play football, spending time with friends and enjoy the summer!
